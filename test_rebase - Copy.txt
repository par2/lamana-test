- Send to remote
- Delete from local
- Rebase from remote
- Try to reset before rebase

- Successful local rebase: applied Remove File to local feature/rebase (0c790fe to 3cfc73f)
- Will no try to send to remote (7f49f7) using git push

- Failed to git push as expected
- Will try to git reset HEAD@{5} --soft, which is 0c790fe, before the rebase
- Rewound the rebase to 0c790fe, but the reflog message is different, saying "reset" instead of orig commit msg.
- Files are staged waiting to be committed.
- git push still failed.  Probably since new commit as still preserved with --soft.  
- Try hard reset, but copy this file to be added after push

- git reset HEAD@{2} --hard, which is new 0c790fe
- Similar reset message at this SHA
- git pushed, still rejected

- Will git reset HEAD@{16} --hard, which is acccd2 before any rebasing
- I was one step behind remote.  I pulled, then tried to push.  Everything was up to date.


- The trigger rebase is still on develop and rebase feature is still ahead, so
- Now will try to pull --rebase origin develop
- Rebased with trigger file and remove file commit.
- Let's try to push...; rejected.
- So even though I did a pull from origin, it still rejects the rebase; the index is locked doing git flow publish
- Let's force push
- Seemed to override remote branch

- Will add this file, commit, and finish rebase branch
- Can't add file to repo due to lock on git index.
- Conclusion: avoid rebasing since can't seem to push to branch.
